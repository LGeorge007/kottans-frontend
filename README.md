**what was new:** 
GIT is absolutely new thing for me. And I'm going to learn it deeply.  Also I gave known about Markdown language.

**what surprised:**  
There is an all-purpose control version system. I used to think that a the system like a git exist separately for each programming language in their IDE. 
And yes! I have made my first pull request!

**what can be used in future:**  
Will use GIT and Markdown language.
Have learnt and will use following commands: git init, git clone, git status, git log, git add, git commit, git diff, git tag, git branch, git checkout, git merge, git push, etc.

**what was new:**  
I haven't used Linux before! All commands are new for me! But it is not shocked me, because similar functional is used in Windows.

**what surprised:**  
It was very interesting to learn about how the HTTP protocol works.

**what can be used in future:**  
I will have some experience, if I face with Linux. I also plan to get acquainted with the work of HTTP and other protocols more closely. For this I plan to 
use articles on Habr + a video course on the basics of networks -- https: //www.asozykin.ru/courses/networks_online.
Got acquainted with the standard Linux's commands and the basics of HTTP and protocol.
